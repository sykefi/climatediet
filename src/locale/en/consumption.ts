  $consumptionActionUsageInfo:
    'Not only what you buy, but the practices of using and taking care of your personal belongings make a difference. For instance, the use of electronic devices creates the majority of their carbon emissions. In the case of a T-shirt, washing and drying account for more of the carbon footprint of the shirt than its raw material production, manufacturing and other life cycle phases. Energy consumption in the use phase affects your electricity bill and housing carbon footprint.',
