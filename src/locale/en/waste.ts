  $wasteResultsSummary:
    'Reducing the amount of waste, and sorting and recycling waste are important in order that products and materials can be re-used and the need for extracting new materials is reduced. The most important thing is to buy less new items in the first place and thus avoid the generation of waste. From the carbon footprint perspective, the majority of emissions result from the production and use phases of products. Therefore, the end-of-life phase, waste processing and transport, do not have a big impact on your footprint.',
