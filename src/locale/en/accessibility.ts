  $accessibilityInformation: `<h2>Accessibility notice</h2>
31.1.2020

This statement concerns the website Climate Diet maintained by the Finnish Environment Institute (Syke).

The EU Web Accessibility Directive (2016/2102) and the Finnish Act on the Provision of Digital Services (306/2019) apply to this website. The purpose of this legislation is to promote equality in a digital society and to achieve a more uniform set of accessibility requirements. Efforts are being taken to meet the accessibility requirements, and Syke aims to guarantee the accessibility of its website.

<h3>Current accessibility</h3>
We have reviewed the website to verify whether it meets the level AA accessibility requirements of WCAG 2.1. The website meets the accessibility requirements partially.

The following functions are not accessible, because the accessibility legislation does not apply to them:
-	PDFs and Word, Excel and PowerPoint files published before 23 September 2018

Some of the website’s functions cannot be made to conform to the accessibility requirements without significant changes and costs. As disabled people rarely need to use these functions and because Syke’s resources are limited, we have concluded that conforming to the accessibility requirements would currently impose a disproportionate burden on Syke. Therefore, we are temporarily applying an exception, based on Article 5 of the Web Accessibility Directive on disproportionate burden, to the following functions:
-	colour contrasts
-	text alternatives of images
-	infographics
-	PDFs and Word, Excel and PowerPoint files published after 23 September 2018
-	tables
- forms

In the future, we will pay more attention to these problem areas. When adding new content to our website, our aim will be to make this content accessible.

If you would like to access information or a service that is currently not accessible in an alternate way, please send us email at saavutettavuus{'@'}ymparisto.fi.
