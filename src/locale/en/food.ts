  $dietSummary: `An omnivorous diet represents the average Finnish diet. If you are mainly a vegetarian but sometimes eat e.g. fish, choose the omnivorous diet and adjust the amounts on the next page.

A vegetarian diet does not include fish or meat.

A vegan diet excludes all animal products. If meat, fish or dairy consumption is below the average or not eaten at all, plant-based protein sources are added to compensate for the animal-based food items.`,
