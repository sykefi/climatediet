  $dietSummary: `Choose the option that best matches your diet. You can later adjust the consumption of individual food groups to align with your diet. For example, if you eat mostly plant-based but occasionally consume meat or fish, start by selecting the vegetarian diet and then add the estimated amount of meat and fish on the next page of the calculator.
  
The default diet for omnivores is based on the average food consumption of Finns. A vegetarian diet does not include meat or fish. Vegans do not consume any animal-derived products. For vegetarian and vegan diets, the estimated consumption is calculated by replacing animal products with equivalent plant-based alternatives.`,
