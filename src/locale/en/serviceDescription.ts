  Climatediet.fi is an online service provided by the Finnish Environment Institute (Syke) that can be used to calculate one's personal carbon footprint caused by housing, transport, food and consumption of other products and services. The calculator gives feedback about your results and suggests actions to reduce your carbon footprint. The first version of the calculator was launched in spring 2010 in cooperation with YLE and the TV series Ilmastodieetit (Eng. climate diets) as well as in cooperation with the Carbon Neutral Municipalities project (HINKU).

  <h3>Principles of calculating</h3>
  The results are indicative. For example, the heat consumption of blocks of flats is measured only according to the whole building and the exact figure of an individual flat cannot be measured. The calculations on consumption of goods and services are estimations, because the carbon footprint of the products have been measured using national accounts and emission data. Exact and coherently calculated product and service specific carbon footprint values do not yet exist, even though research and knowledge base in that sector is constantly improving. The principles of calculating are specified as more suitable information becomes available. Calculation and its documentation have been updated and completed with project funding (Ekokoti project of the Finnish Ministry of the Environment, in cooperation with Sitra, IRKE project of the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture) in years 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2019.
